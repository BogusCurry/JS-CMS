# JS-CMS
JavaScript-based content management system.

A simple* CMS (not really a CMS) based on JavaScript. No PHP, no servers.

The news content can be modified by editing the /etc/news.js file.

Consider this a website template. It's useful when you have to make a website with dynamic content, but you don't want to bother by installing any of those over-complicated CMS.

*Note: For geeks.
